# ked

ked is simple console text editor for GNU/Linux, compilable with minimal dependency.

## Goal

Though this is my hobby project, I would like to make this text editor easy-to-use for
both Emacs user and beginner of console text editor.

## Install

You should be able to compile with executing `make` command in project root.
Currently, `install` rule is not provided so you'll need to copy binary to
somewhere you set in `PATH`, to use this command anywhere.
